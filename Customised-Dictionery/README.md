# Customised-Dictionery
This is my first exercise which I did while learning python as my first programming language. I made it using pycharm IDE. 
It is an English dictionary which gives meaning of selected words.

It is the most basic project I made using python.
It gives out the meaning of 'acquantince','audacious','cartographer','decorum'.
