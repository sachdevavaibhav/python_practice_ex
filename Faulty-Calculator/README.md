# Faulty-Calculator
This is my second basic project with python. It is a faulty calculator which gives wrong results for some selected calculations.

A teacher in a school figures out that a student is going to use calculator in the exam(which is not allowed) so, the teacher thought of modifying the calculator such that it gives wrong result for the calculation given in the exam.
